Errors discovered in the data files
a. hobo: TNC_24_CLDHO_1_2019_masterfile.xlsx has 10460 rows with wrong year, site, and logger values (numbers increase sequentially)
b. hobo: TNC_16_PKHO_10_2017_masterfile.xlsx site name was TNC instead of TNC_16
c. various hobo files: 17952 rows from various files with large negative data values (-9999.00 or -888.88)
d. hydro: TNC_25_CLDHY_2_masterfile_2017.xlsx sheet name is "2021" instead of "2017"
e. hydro: TNC_81_CLDHY2_2020_masterfile.xlsx site name "CLDHY-2" should be "CLDHY_2" for consistency 

Data issues noticable from plots
a. A few temperature data spikes on ends of timeseries.
  # fixed by removing obvious outliers at start of time series in 3 cases (before calculating tmax)
  	(site == "TNC_25" & year == 2018 & day == 122)
  	(site == "TNC_23" & year == 2018 & day == 122)
  	(site == "TNC_23" & year == 2021 & day == 118)
b. Prolonged dips in DO to near 0 that aren't removed by flags (in unadjusted DO data)
c. Whole years disappear when using adjusted vs. unadjusted DO

Questions
a. Why do some years disappear in DO adjusted?
b. Represent DO data as proportion of days under threshold (due to variable amounts of missing data)?
