Plot A: Daily maximum temperature. NT = Non-trout threshold; TM = Trout maintenance threshold; TP = Trout production threshold.

Plot B: 7-day rolling average of daily maximum temperature. NT = Non-trout threshold; TM = Trout maintenance threshold; TP = Trout production threshold.

Plot C: The number of days with temperatures exceeding SWQS thresholds for each site in each year monitored. Years with < 80% of coverage in summer months (Jun 1-Aug 31) are shown as asterisks (*) and may be biased low.

Plot C (individual plots): the folder "PlotC_individual" contains the same information as Plot C, but with separate plots for each individual site.

Plot D: The number of days with temperatures exceeding SWQS thresholds for each site in each year monitored. Years with < 80% of coverage in summer months (Jun 1-Aug 31) are not shown.

Plot E: Daily minimum dissolved oxygen. NT = Non-trout threshold; TM = Trout maintenance threshold; TP = Trout production threshold.

Plot F: 24-hour average of dissolved oxygen readings. NT = Non-trout threshold; TM = Trout maintenance threshold; there is no Trout production threshold for this metric.

Plot G: The number of days with dissolved oxygen readings below minimum SWQS thresholds for each site in each year monitored. Years with < 80% of coverage in summer months (Jun 1-Aug 31) are shown as asterisks (*) and may be biased low.

Plot G (individual plots): the folder "PlotG_individual" contains the same information as Plot G, but with separate plots for each individual site.

Plot H: The number of days with dissolved oxygen readings below minimum SWQS thresholds for each site in each year monitored. Years with < 80% of coverage in summer months (Jun 1-Aug 31) are not shown.

Plot I: Each site plotted based on the average number of days its temperature and dissolved oxygen exceeded SWQS Trout Maintenance criteria.

Plot J: The number of days where either dissolved oxygen or temperature readings exceeded SWQS thresholds for each site in each year monitored. Years with < 80% of coverage in summer months (Jun 1-Aug 31) for either temperature or DO are not shown.

Plot K: Daily probability of exceeding Trout Maintenance temperature standards during summer (Jun-Aug) for each site over time. River mean shows the pooled estimate (across all sites) for each year. Estimates are from a Bayesian hierarchical (random-effects binomial) model inlcuding separate intercept and slope of year for each site. Annual sample sizes of days monitored (sites) or number of sites (River mean) are shown at the bottom of each plot.

Plot L: Daily probability of exceeding Trout Maintenance dissolved oxygen standards during summer (Jun-Aug) for each site over time. River mean shows the pooled estimate (across all sites) for each year. Estimates are from a Bayesian hierarchical (random effects binomial) model inlcuding separate intercept and slope of year for each site. Annual sample sizes of days monitored (sites) or number of sites (River mean) are shown at the bottom of each plot.

Plot M: Estimated daily probability of exceeding Trout Maintenance temperature thresholds, standardized (predicted) to 2018 conditions. Standardizing allows comparisons across all sites though they were monitored during in different years. Estimates are from a Bayesian hierarchical (random effects binomial) model inlcuding separate intercept and slope of year for each site.

Plot N: Predicted mean maximum temperature for each site on July 15th each year. Predicting to this date is a way of standardizing estimates of temperature conditions across sites given that each site was measured for different time periods each year. Estimates were based on a General Additive Model (GAM) of daily maximum temperature vs. day for each year, including a covariate for site. 

Plot O: Predicted mean minimum dissolved oxygen for each site on July 15th each year. Predicting to this date is a way of standardizing estimates of dissolved oxygen conditions across sites given that each site was measured for different time periods each year. Estimates were based on a General Additive Model (GAM) of daily minimum dissolved oxygen vs. day for each year, including a covariate for site.

Plot P: Predicted mean minimum dissolved oxygen and maximum temperature for each site on July 15th, 2018. Predicting to this date is a way of standardizing estimates of dissolved oxygen (DO) conditions given that each site was measured for different time periods each year. Estimates were based on 2 General Additive Models (GAMs) including daily minimum DO or maximum temperature vs. day for each year, including a covariate for site.
