Plot A: Mean macroinvertebrate index by monitoring location (points) along with lines showing the maximum and minimum index values for each site across all years. The number of monitoring years for each site is shown on the right margin of the plot.

Plot B: A scatterplot matrix showing the relationships among the seven component indices comprising the final macroinvertebrate index. Data from all sites and years are combined. The panels below the diagonal show bivariate scatter plots of pairs of variables with a loess smoothing line illustrating trend. The panels above the diagnonal show the Spearman's Rank Correlations among variables. The panels along the diagonal show histograms of each variable.

Plot(s) C: Radar plots for each monitoring site showing the values of the seven component indices comprising the final macroinvertebrate index. The indices each range from 0-100. The abbreviated names on the plots correspond to the index names in the data file as follows: num_gen = Total # of genera; pct_noninsect = % non-insect genera; pct_ept = % sensitive EPT (excluding Hydropyschidae, including Diplectrona); num_scraper = # of scraper genera; hilsenhoff = Hilsenhoff Biotic Index; num_talu2 = # NJ TALU attribute 2 genera; num_talu3 = # NJ TALU attribute 3 genera.

Plot(s) D: Time series plots of the overall macroinvertebrate index by monitoring site.

Plot(s) E & F: Time series plots of the overall macroinvertebrate index for the two monitoring sites upstream/downstream of Columbia Dam (Plot E) and Paulina Dam (Plot F).

Plot G: Mean habitat score by monitoring location (points) along with lines showing the maximum and minimum score values for each site across all years. The number of monitoring years for each site is shown on the right margin of the plot.

Plot H: Points show the mean habitat score (x-axis) and mean macroinvertebrate score (y-axis) by monitoring location. The lines show the minimum and maximum score and index values for each site across all years.

Plot I:  A scatterplot matrix showing the relationships among the 13 component indices comprising the final habitat score. Data from all sites and years are combined. The panels below the diagonal show bivariate scatter plots of pairs of variables with a loess smoothing line illustrating trend. The panels above the diagnonal show the Spearman's Rank Correlations among variables. The panels along the diagonal show histograms of each variable.

Plot(s) J: Radar plots for each monitoring site showing the values of the 13 component indices comprising the final habitat score. The abbreviated names on the plots correspond to the index names in the data file as follows: Epifaun. sub. = Epifaunal Substrate/Available Cover; Pool sub. = Pool Substrate Characterization; Pool var. = Pool variability; Sediment dep. = Sediment Deposition; Channel flow = Channel Flow Status; Channel alt. = Channel Alteration; Channel sin. = Channel sinuosity; Bank stab. L = Bank Stability-LB; Bank stab. R = Bank Stability-RB; Bank veg. L = Bank vegetation Protection-LB; Bank veg. R = Bank vegetation Protection-RB; Rip. zone L = Ripariarn Vegetation Zone Width-LB; Rip. zone R = Ripariarn Vegetation Zone Width-RB.

Plot(s) K: Time series plots of the overall habitat score by monitoring site.
