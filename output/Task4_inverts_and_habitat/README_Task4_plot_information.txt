Plot A: Mean macroinvertebrate index by monitoring location (points) with lines showing the range (maximum and minimum) of index values for each site across all years. The dashed vertical lines show the lower threshold boundaries of each macroinvertebrate index quality category (Excellent: > 63; Good: 42-62; Fair: 21-41; Poor: < 21). Points are also colored according to index quality category. The number of monitoring years for each site is shown on the right margin of the plot.

Plot B: A scatterplot matrix showing the relationships among the seven component indices comprising the final macroinvertebrate index. Data from all sites and years are combined. The panels below the diagonal show bivariate scatter plots of pairs of variables with a loess smoothing line illustrating trend. The panels above the diagnonal show the Spearman's Rank Correlations among variables. The panels along the diagonal show histograms of each variable.

Plot(s) C: Radar plots for each monitoring site showing the values of the seven component indices comprising the final macroinvertebrate index. The indices each range from 0-100. The abbreviated names on the plots correspond to the index names in the data file as follows: num_gen = Total # of genera; pct_noninsect = % non-insect genera; pct_ept = % sensitive EPT (excluding Hydropyschidae, including Diplectrona); num_scraper = # of scraper genera; hilsenhoff = Hilsenhoff Biotic Index; num_talu2 = # NJ TALU attribute 2 genera; num_talu3 = # NJ TALU attribute 3 genera.

Plot(s) D: Time series plots of the overall macroinvertebrate index by monitoring site.

Plot(s) E & F: Time series plots of the overall macroinvertebrate index for the two monitoring sites upstream/downstream of Columbia Dam (Plot E) and Paulina Dam (Plot F). Dashed lines show the lower threshold boundaries of index quality categories (see legends for Plots A and G above).

Plot G: Points represent the mean habitat score by monitoring location. Lines shows the maximum and minimum score values for each site across all years. The dashed vertical lines show the lower threshold boundaries of each habitat quality score category (Optimal: > 160; Sub-optimal: 110-159; Marginal: 60-109; Poor: < 60). Points are also colored according to habitat quality score category. The number of monitoring years for each site is shown on the right margin of the plot.

Plot H: Points show the mean habitat score (x-axis) and mean macroinvertebrate score (y-axis) by monitoring location. The lines show the minimum and maximum score and index values for each site across all years. Dashed lines show the lower threshold boundaries of index quality categories (see legends for Plots A and G above).

Plot I:  A scatterplot matrix showing the relationships among the 13 component indices comprising the final habitat score. Data from all sites and years are combined. The panels below the diagonal show bivariate scatter plots of pairs of variables with a loess smoothing line illustrating trend. The panels above the diagnonal show the Spearman's Rank Correlations among variables. The panels along the diagonal show histograms of each variable.

Plot(s) J: Radar plots for each monitoring site showing the values of the 13 component indices comprising the final habitat score. The abbreviated names on the plots correspond to the index names in the data file as follows: Epifaun. sub. = Epifaunal Substrate/Available Cover; Pool sub. = Pool Substrate Characterization; Pool var. = Pool variability; Sediment dep. = Sediment Deposition; Channel flow = Channel Flow Status; Channel alt. = Channel Alteration; Channel sin. = Channel sinuosity; Bank stab. = Bank Stability; Bank veg. = Bank vegetation Protection; Rip. zone = Ripariarn Vegetation Zone Width.

Plot(s) K: Time series plots of the overall habitat quality score by monitoring site. (Separate timeseries plot for each site.)

Plot(s) L: Time series plots of the habitat quality index and the macroinvertebrate index for each site. The habitat index, normally on a scale of 0-200, has been divided by 2 so that it is on a scale of 0-100 to match the macroinvertebrate index. Dashed lines show the lower threshold boundaries of index quality categories (see legends for Plots A and G above). (Separate plot for each site.)

Plot M: Time series plot of the mean habitat quality index and the mean macroinvertebrate index across all monitoring locations for each year. Error bars show 2 standar errors of the mean. The number of sampling locations (n) available to compute the mean is shown at the bottom of the plot in gray. The habitat index, normally on a scale of 0-200, has been divided by 2 so that it is on a scale of 0-100 to match the macroinvertebrate index. Dashed lines show the lower threshold boundaries of index quality categories (see legends for Plots A and G above). A mixed effect linear model (random effect of site and fixed effect of year) detected no significant increase or decrease over time (see Models A and B in the Task 4 "statistical_analysis" folder).

Plot N: Points show the mean habitat score (x-axis) and mean macroinvertebrate score (y-axis) by monitoring location. Points are colored according to their mean July temperature (C) across all years of monitoring based on temperature logger data (points lacking logger data are colored gray). The error bars show the minimum and maximum score and index values for each site across all years. Dashed lines show the lower threshold boundaries of index quality categories (see legends for Plots A and G above).

Plot O: Points show the mean habitat score (x-axis) and mean macroinvertebrate score (y-axis) by monitoring location. Points are colored according to their mean July dissolved oxygen concentration (mg/L) across all years of monitoring based on logger data (points lacking DO data are colored gray). The error bars show the minimum and maximum score and index values for each site across all years. Dashed lines show the lower threshold boundaries of index quality categories (see legends for Plots A and G above).

Plot P: Points show the mean July DO readings in mg/L (x-axis) and mean macroinvertebrate index score (y-axis) by monitoring location. Points are colored according to their mean July temperature (C). Temperature and DO data are averaged across all years of monitoring based on  logger data Invertebrate monitoring stations lacking logger data are ommitted. The line shows the best-fit linear relationship between July DO and the invertebrate index (slope: 8.4, p = 0.005, see Model C in the Task 4 "statistical_analysis" folder). Shaded area represents the 95% confidence interval for the prediction line. Dashed lines show the lower threshold boundaries of macroinvertebrate index quality categories (see legends for Plots A and G above). The labels on each dot display the monitoring station number.

Plot(s) Q & R: Time series plots of the overall macroinvertebrate index for the two monitoring sites upstream/downstream of the tree planting restoration area (Plot Q) and Hyper Humus (Plot R). Dashed lines show the lower threshold boundaries of index quality categories (see legends for Plots A and G above).

Model A: This model tested whether there is a negative or positive temporal trend in habitat scores on average across sites. 3 sites with < 4 years of data were excluded, but results were very similar when they were included. While the trend slope was slightly positive (+ 0.93 index points per year), the result was not statistically significant (p = 0.398).

Model B: This model tested whether there is a negative or positive temporal trend in macroinvertebrate scores on average across sites. 5 sites with < 4 years of data were excluded, but results were very similar when they were included. While the trend slope was slightly negative (-0.30 index points per year), the result was not statistically significant (p = 0.636).

Model C: This model tested whether there is an effect of on mean July temperature, mean July dissolved oxygen, or mean habitat quality score on the mean macroinvertebrate score across sites. The model including July temperature and dissolved oxygen performed best based on AIC, but was very similar to that of the model only containing dissolved oxygen (AIC = 103.05 vs. 103.02). In the top-performing model, only dissolved oxygen was statistically significant, with a positive slope predicting an increase in macroinvertebrate index of 8.4 points per each mg/L increase in dissolved oxygen (p = 0.005).
