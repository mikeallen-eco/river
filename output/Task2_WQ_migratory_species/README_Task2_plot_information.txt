Plot A: Daily mean temperature is shown for each year in red, with variability shown as bars spanning the daily minimum and maximum values. Black circles represent monthly averages of the daily means, along with variability shown as bars spanning the mean minimum and mean maximumn daily values. There are 18 plots, one for each site. 

Plot B: Monthly average temperature is shown for each year (the mean of daily average temperature) along with a gray shaded area representing the daily minimum and maximum temperature value recorded for each day across all years of monitoring. There are 18 plots, one for each site.

Plot C: Daily mean dissolved oxygen is shown for each year in blue, with variability shown as bars spanning the daily minimum and maximum values. Black circles represent monthly averages of the daily means, along variability shown as bars spanning the mean minimum and mean maximumn daily values. There are 18 plots, one for each site. 

Plot D: Monthly average dissolved oxygen is shown for each year (the mean of daily average dissolved oxygen) along with a gray shaded area representing the daily minimum and maximum dissolved oxygen value recorded for each day across all years of monitoring. There are 18 plots, one for each site.

Plot E: The mean temperature (mean of daily average temperatures) for periods covering each major migratory fish life stage are shown in each year. Dates are based on Rutgers data from the Raritan River and those described for American Shad in an extension report from Maryland (Klauda and Fischer, undated). Optimal egg development temperature and required temperature range for larvae/juveniles is for American Shad as reported by Klauda and Fischer (undated). Spring migration: 15 April - 15 May; Spawning: 16-31 May; Larvae: 1-30 June; Juvenile: 1 July - 15 Sept.; Fall migration: 16 Sept. - 30 Nov. Variability is shown as bars spanning the mean daily minimum and mean daily maximumn values. There is a plot for each site. 

Plot F: The mean dissolved oxygen level (mean of daily average values) for periods covering each major migratory fish life stage are shown in each year. Dates are based on Rutgers data from the Raritan River and those described for American Shad in an extension report from Maryland (Klauda and Fischer, undated). Required DO range for eggs/larvae/juveniles is for American Shad as reported by Klauda and Fischer (undated). Spring migration: 15 April - 15 May; Spawning: 16-31 May; Larvae: 1-30 June; Juvenile: 1 July - 15 Sept.; Fall migration: 16 Sept. - 30 Nov. Variability is shown as bars spanning the mean daily minimum and mean daily maximumn values. There are 18 plots, one for each site. There are 18 plots, one for each site. 

Plot G: Statistical comparison of temperatures across sites within periods representing major migratory fish life stages. Circles represent predicted mean temperature based on a linear mixed-effect model with date nested within year as random effects, and site as a fixed effect. Error bars represent bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals for these predictions (n = 1000 iterations). Dates for the migratory fish life stages are based on Rutgers data from the Raritan River and those described for American Shad in an extension report from Maryland (Klauda and Fischer, undated). Spring migration: 15 April - 15 May; Spawning: 16-31 May; Larvae: 1-30 June; Juvenile: 1 July - 15 Sept.; Fall migration: 16 Sept. - 30 Nov. Only sites accessible to migratory fish were included. For more details on the models see ModelsA-E in the Task 2 statistical_analysis folder.

Plots H-M: Statistical assessment of temperatures trends across years within periods representing major migratory fish life stages. Lines represent the predicted mean temperature trend across all sites based on a linear mixed-effects model. Year was treated as a continuous fixed effect. A random intercept of site and day of season (categorical) was included in the model, along with a random slope of year within site (assuming correlated random slope and intercept). Alternative models with unocorrelated slope/intercept and with only a random intercept were evaluated; these were found to perform less well than the correlated slopes model based on likelihood ratio tests in each stage. Shaded areas represent 95% confidence intervals based on the fixed effects only. Only the year trend for the spawning season (1-15 May) was significant with an increasing trend of 0.14 C / year (p = 0.007). Circles are the average of the site means of daily temperature +/- 2 SE. Fall average values diverge from model estimates as most fall monitoring data was concentrated in the earlier, warmer months of the season, while model predictions estimate average (mid-season) conditions. For fall, a model that does not control for date is also shown (dashed line), but was also non-significant. Dates for the migratory fish life stages are based on Rutgers data from the Raritan River and those described for American Shad in an extension report from Maryland (Klauda and Fischer, undated). Spring migration: 15 April - 15 May; Spawning: 16-31 May; Larvae: 1-30 June; Juvenile: 1 July - 15 Sept.; Fall migration: 16 Sept. - 30 Nov. Only sites accessible to migratory fish were included. For more details on the models see ModelsF-J in the Task 2 statistical_analysis folder.

Plots N-T: Statistical assessment of dissolved oxygen trends across years within periods representing major migratory fish life stages. Lines represent the predicted mean dissolved oxygen trend across all sites based on a linear mixed-effects model. Year was treated as a continuous fixed effect. A random intercept of site and day of season (categorical) was included in the model, along with a random slope of year within site (assuming correlated random slope and intercept). Alternative models with unocorrelated slope/intercept and with only a random intercept were evaluated; these were found to perform less well than the correlated slopes model based on likelihood ratio tests in each stage. Shaded areas represent 95% confidence intervals based on the fixed effects only. Only the year trend for the spring migration season (15 Apr - 15 May) was significant, with a decreasing trend of -0.1 mg/ L / year (p = 0.028). However, caution is likely warranted in interpretting this result as this season contained only four years of data. Circles are the average of the site means of daily temperature +/- 2 SE. Fall average values diverge from model estimates as most fall monitoring data was concentrated in the earlier, warmer months of the season, while model predictions estimate average (mid-season) conditions. For fall, a model that does not control for date is also shown (dashed line), but was also non-significant.
