The 2016-2021 macroinvertebrate and habitat data in this folder was downloaded on April 28, 2022 from the Box drive. Only one small change was made to the files: in file "macro_habitat_data_2018_2019.xlsx" in the tab "Habitat_2019", I changed "4/12/12019" to "4/12/2019" for site TNC_6. If you are adding new files, be sure to copy the formatting and naming conventions of the 2020-2021 files (e.g., the next file should be 2022-2023 with the same column names, etc.). The structure of the data in the tab for each year in the 2020-2021 files differs. As a result, your 2022-2023 file should match structures tab-for-tab: the structure of the 2022 tab should match that of the 2020 tab, and the 2023 tab should match that of the 2021 tab.
