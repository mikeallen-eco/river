To do (* = done; - = not done)

Task 5: 
* recompile logger data with TNC_4 & 16 (2016) and TNC_5 (2017)
- make sure logger compile will work with new data automatically (reads max year and looks for it)
- make sure logger compile will work with new logger format (new logger type example file)
- remake all relevant logger-based plots with recompiled data

   (in 2021 format)

Task 4
* fix counting of sites in Plot A & G (n = XX)
* Plot G: make color coded like in plot A
* fix decimal years in Plot D
* put entire Rating legend on each plot in Plot D (and make in correct order)
* mark the boundaries of the assessment score ratings on Plot D
* put rating numerical ranges of in Plot D (lines & labels instead) 
* read in and format 2020-2021 data
* update plots with 2020-2021 data
* Put TNC_80 on the Columbia Dam macroinvertebrate plot (E)
* Rename Plot J files (from "Plot C")
* Plot J: Combine Left and right bank indices to one number (scale 0-20)
* rename plot K files (from "Plot D")
* put entire hab score legend on each plot in Plot K (and make in correct order)
* mark boundaries of hab score categories on plot with lines
* put numerical ranges of hab score categories in plots (lines & labels instead) 
* make new plot combining Plots D and Plots K (macro and habitat) into one graph 
* plot changes in mean habitat and macro index over time (all sites)
* Make statistical models of that too
* fix habitat threshold values
* plot K: add poor category in legend
* plot H: put lines and annotations showing quality categories
* new version of plot H but coloring points to show mean (july?) temps 
* new version of plot H but w/ coloring points to show mean DO
* update Task 4 README
* Plot P - can't see number clearly in yellow circle - change color scheme so number (9) is visible.
* update formatting on Plots E&F
* new plot for the tree project (sites 4, 5, 8) like Plots E&F? 
* new plot for hyper (2) that look like Plots E&F? 

Task 3
* Plots T & U: add labels for temp and DO
* Plot U: add TNC_13 to this graph; keep name as County Line Dam
* make new Plot T-type figure for tree sites (TNC_4, 5, 8)
* make new Plot T-type figure for Columbia (with 80 & 81 too?)
* make 2 new Plot N-type figs for Columbia but with temp & DO (add sites 80 and 81 too; maybe as a 2nd version?)
* make Plot R-type fig for Columbia (add 80 & 81?)
* make Plot S-type fig for Columbia

Task 2
* Plot E & F: add text for date range and optimal values (literature)
* exclude the 6 "no fish" sites from anything involving fish stages (not monthly avg. stuff)
* Plot F: add "larvae" stage to graphs
* Plot G: fix the x-axis ticks (missing on some panels)
* Redo Models F-J excluding 2 Del. River sites
* update Plots H-M based on models w/o Del. River sites
* Plots H-M: make all the y-axes the same range
* Redo Models K-O excluding 2 Del. River sites
* update Plots N-T based on models w/o Del. River sites
* Plots N-T: make all the y-axes the same range
* Plot S: make "DO" uppercase in y-axis legend
* make each plot runnable (after running first chunk; save model objects)
* Models: repaste output into text files after excluding non-fish and del river sites
* Plot D: remove lines connected points spanning missing data

Task 1: 
* TNC_5 missing temp/DO data in 2017 [no data for that year on Box]
* same for TNC_80 in 2018 [Michelle clarified: no 2018 data collected]
* improve label visibitility in Plot I
* Plots K & L: exclude Del. river sites (26 and 27)
* improve label visibitility in Plot P
* Plot I: clarify figure caption (is it a straight-up average)?
* make sure each plot is runnable after running only first chunk
