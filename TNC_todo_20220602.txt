To do (* = done; - = not done)

Task 4
* fix counting of sites in Plot A & G (n = XX)
* Plot G: make color coded like in plot A
* fix decimal years in Plot D
* put entire Rating legend on each plot in Plot D (and make in correct order)
* mark the boundaries of the assessment score ratings on Plot D
* put rating numerical ranges of in Plot D (lines & labels instead) 
* read in and format 2020-2021 data
* update plots with 2020-2021 data
* Put TNC_80 on the Columbia Dam macroinvertebrate plot (E)
* Rename Plot J files (from "Plot C")
* Plot J: Combine Left and right bank indices to one number (scale 0-20)
* rename plot K files (from "Plot D")
* put entire hab score legend on each plot in Plot K (and make in correct order)
* mark boundaries of hab score categories on plot with lines
* put numerical ranges of hab score categories in plots (lines & labels instead) 
* make new plot combining Plots D and Plots K (macro and habitat) into one graph 
* plot changes in mean habitat and macro index over time (all sites)
* Make statistical models of that too
* fix habitat threshold values
* plot K: add poor category in legend
* plot H: put lines and annotations showing quality categories
* new version of plot H but coloring points to show mean (july?) temps 
* new version of plot H but w/ coloring points to show mean DO
* update Task 4 README

Task 3
- Plots T & U: add labels for temp and DO
- make new Plot T-type figure for tree sites (TNC_4, 5, 8)
- make new Plot T-type figure for Columbia (with 80 & 81 too?)
- make 2 new Plot N-type figs for Columbia but with temp & DO (add sites 80 and 81 too; maybe as a 2nd version?)
- make Plot R-type fig for Columbia (add 80 & 81?)
- make Plot S-type fig for Columbia
- Plot U: add TNC_13 to this graph; keep name as County Line Dam

Task 2
- Plot D: remove lines connected points spanning missing data
- Plot E: add annotation for date range and optimal values (literature)
- exclude the 6 "no fish" sites from anything involving fish stages (not monthly avg. stuff)
- Plot F: add "larvae" stage to graphs
- Plot G: fix the x-axis ticks (missing on some panels)
- Model A: repaste output into ModelA text file (fixed effects were missing for some reason)
- Plots H-M: make all the y-axes the same range
- Plots N-T: same
- Plot S: make "DO" uppercase in y-axis legend

Task 1: 
- why is TNC_4 missing temp/DO data in 2016? (fix tables/figs if needed)
- why is TNC_5 missing temp/DO data in 2017 (fix tables/figs if needed)
- same for TNC_80 in 2018
- Plots K & L: if time, break up these plots into individual plots by site
- improve label visibitility in Plot I, K, and L
- Plot I: clarify figure caption (is it a straight-up average)?

General to all tasks:
- make sure 26 & 27 don't figure into any "river-wide" analyses
- can tables be exported as PDFs?
