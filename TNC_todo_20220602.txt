To do (* = done; - = not done)

Task 4
* fix counting of sites in Plot A & G (n = XX)
* Plot G: make color coded like in plot A
* fix decimal years in Plot D
* put entire Rating legend on each plot in Plot D (and make in correct order)
* mark the boundaries of the assessment score ratings on Plot D
* put rating numerical ranges of in Plot D (lines & labels instead) 
* read in and format 2020-2021 data
* update plots with 2020-2021 data
* Put TNC_80 on the Columbia Dam macroinvertebrate plot (E)
* Rename Plot J files (from "Plot C")
* Plot J: Combine Left and right bank indices to one number (scale 0-20)
* rename plot K files (from "Plot D")
* put entire hab score legend on each plot in Plot K (and make in correct order)
* mark boundaries of hab score categories on plot with lines
* put numerical ranges of hab score categories in plots (lines & labels instead) 
* make new plot combining Plots D and Plots K (macro and habitat) into one graph 
* plot changes in mean habitat and macro index over time (all sites)
- Make models of that too
* fix habitat threshold values
* plot K: add poor category in legend
* plot H: put lines and annotations showing quality categories
* new version of plot H but coloring points to show mean (july?) temps 
* new version of plot H but w/ coloring points to show mean DO
- update Task 4 README

Task 3
- make hyperhumus-type figure for tree planting project sites
- rename County Line to Paulinkill (naming error)
- Make same fig for County Line Dam
- Remove 26 and 27 from all plots (even for Task 2? ask Michelle)

Task 2
- Plot D: remove lines connected points spanning missing data
- Plot E: add annotation for date range
IMPORTANT: - Plot F: add "larvae" stage to graphs
- Model A: repaste output into ModelA text file (fixed effects were missing for some reason)
- Plots H-M: make all the y-axes the same range
- Plots N-T: same
- Plot S: make "DO" uppercase in y-axis legend

Task 1: 
- Plots K & L: if time, break up these plots into individual plots by site
- TNC_23: plot B, check on (remove?) the outlier high temp in November 2019
- improve label visibitility in Plot I, K, and L
